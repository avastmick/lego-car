# Lego Car Controller

Simple Raspberrypi-based project to control a Technics Lego Truck

This is the basis for my daughter's Grade 3 science fair project.

Nothing too complicated:

- Build the truck
- Add a motor to drive wheels
    + Create RP module to control motor, forward and back
- Add a servo to steer
    + Create RP module to control servo, left and right

- Test on bench
- Create controller program
    + Start
    + Go left
    + Go right
    + Stop
